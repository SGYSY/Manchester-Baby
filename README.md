**This C++ project uses Qt5 for implementing GUI and is configured by QMake.**

## üëè Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a **Linux** machine. This project has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, but it should work on other distributions as well.
- You have installed **Qt5**. Check your Qt and QMake version using the command `qmake --version`. This project has been tested with Qt version 5.9.5 and QMake version 3.1.
- You have installed **Qt Creator**. This will provide a user-friendly interface for managing and compiling the project.

## üì¶ Setup

Follow these steps to get this project ready for compiling and running:

1. Open the project `ManchesterBaby` in Qt Creator. The `ManchesterBaby.pro` file in the project should be detected and selectable when navigating the project location.

2. Qt Creator should prompt that the project has not been configured. Configure the project using the **Desktop** kit.

3. If necessary (for usually this is automatically done, but it is always a good idea to double-check), manually set to use the Qt5 version of QMake:

    + Go to `Tools > Options`.

    + Navigate to the `Build & Run` section, and then the `Qt Versions` tab.

    + Click `Add...` and navigate to the location of the Qt5 QMake binary (usually `/YOUR_PATH_TO/Qt5.x.x/gcc_64/bin/qmake`).

    + Click `Apply` and `OK`.

4. You should see all the C++ code files (**FOUR** `.cpp` files including `main.cpp` and **THREE** `.h` files) in `Headers ` and `Sources` sections in the `Projects ` view area on the left (Expand the `ManchesterBaby` folder first if you haven't). If not, check the `ManchesterBaby.pro` file and make sure the following part is correct:

    ```QMake
    SOURCES += \
            main.cpp \
            widget.cpp \
            baby.cpp \
            assembler.cpp
    
    HEADERS += \
            widget.h \
            baby.h \
            assembler.h
    ```

‚Äã		Save the file (`Ctrl` + `S`) after every time you make a change to this file, or any other files.

## ‚ú® Starting the program

1. Build the project (`Ctrl` + `B`). This will create a `build-ManchesterBaby-Desktop-debug` directory in your project root (The same level as the `ManchesterBaby` folder). Make sure you can find it.
2. If you haven't done so, rename your assembly language file to `assemble.txt` and put the file into the `build-ManchesterBaby-Desktop-debug` directory.
3. Compile and run the program (`Ctrl` + `R`). Make sure the Qt Creator is working on the correct project and is currently in `Debug` mode before running. These can be checked right above the `Run` button.

## üß© Operting the Assembler & Simulator

After the program starts, the assembler in the program will read the `assemble.txt`. A log file named `log.txt` will be generated by the assembler to record every step of the process of translating assembly language (including whether each of them is successful or not), in `build-ManchesterBaby-Desktop-debug` folder. 

Then the GUI window for Manchester Baby simulator will automatically appear. The large text display area on the left in the window represents the machine code generated by the assembler. If the window does not appear, or the machine code seems to differ from what **should** be translated from your assembly language program, it's likely that something is wrong with the assembler language file provided. Check the `log.txt` in these cases.

There are three buttons to interact with in the simulator window:

+ `Reload MC`: Refreshes the machine code display area. It's unlikely that you need to press this manually at any stage, for this will be done automatically when starting the program, and when the Manchester Baby simulator is running.
+ `Run`: Starts (or restarts) running the simulator. The program will execute each step at 1-second intervals. If you are using it for restarting, note that the memory could have been updated during the baby's last execution and restarting may lead to inconsistent results with expectations.
+ `End`: Stops the simulator, like manually giving a `HALT` instruction to the baby. This only works when the simulator is running.

The information panel on the right displays all the essential information during execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Information

Please ensure that your system does not have any overly dependencies that might conflict with the project. This project has been tested with GCC 7.5.0 and GNU Make 4.1.
